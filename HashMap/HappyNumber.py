# 202. Happy Number
"""
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
    Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
